This software detects and warns cats entering the car in cold months. The blank image of the car hood is saved first. Then, the second image is compared with the first image by scanning each time it is used, and if there is a difference, the system gives a warning.
The system works with the logic of yes-no. Even if there is a broken or loosening screw inside the vehicle, it can see and warn it.
